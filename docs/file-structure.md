├── runtime.py                   # main-thread side: 0.5 s timer + load_post/save_post/exit_pre handlers — hands the worker the scene context, sets status.current(), redraws on change (request_redraw() for a running Send), cancels a Send when another file opens, tells link_journal about loads and saves
├── status.py                    # status machine, first failing check wins: NOT_CONNECTED (WAITING_APPROVAL) → ONLINE_ACCESS_OFF → CONNECTING/OFFLINE → OUTDATED → NO_PROJECT → NO_BROWSER → READY; UI texts

├── project_operators.py         # Refresh Projects, New project (named after the .blend or the scene — default_name(), then bound), Open in browser

│
│   # Send — the job, its network side, what it covers
├── send_job.py                  # SendJob: a Send as short main-thread steps from a timer (small channels, HDRI, then objects: key (a copy's or set's source hashed once) → missing glbs and placements? → bake + export → upload), pause outside Object Mode / off its scene, Cancel, per-channel rows + fraction (an unreadable HDRI fails only its own row), Report; can_send() poll; start(); blocking loop in background mode
├── send_operators.py            # Send All, Resend Everything, Cancel, and SendChannelBase (scope 'panel'|'selected'|'all', Shift+click = resend) every channel button builds on; Scene.skyray_scope
├── uploader.py                  # a Send's daemon thread, never bpy: /missing queries, raw /resource uploads (textures the browser lacks, then the glb; an HDRI or a set's placements on their own), /sync messages in queue order, consecutive object entries batched; first error stops the Send
├── send_channels.py             # the small channels built from the job's own scene (SendContext): render settings, sky, lights, cameras (what the Objects row covers, scene_graph.data_objects) — a payload or the reason to skip
├── scene_graph.py               # plan(): which objects a Send covers (scope — Selected takes everything under the selection too —, Skip Hidden, hidden ancestors kept for hierarchy), a Collection Instance's copies and the instance sets of geometry nodes and particles as entries of their own, stable ids, scene-wide deletions (copies and sets too); entry_payload() (transform from matrix_local or the copy's own, `glb` = object key, `instanceOf`, `placements`); data_objects(): the lights/cameras whose data a Send carries (the shown ones the scope names, never an ancestor kept only for hierarchy); summary() for the panel rows (Objects counts every entry, whatever its type, a Collection Instance's copies too)
├── collection_copies.py         # copies(): a Collection Instance's objects (collections inside too, Collection Instances inside as copies of copies) as entries under the empty — evaluated transform, id from the parent's id and the source's name, `instanceOf` the source; geometry, empties and armatures only
├── instance_sets.py             # gather(): one pass over the scene's instances grouping each owner's (geometry nodes, particles drawn as objects) by source object or node-made mesh; blob(): a group's placements as the browser's `p:` blob (PLC1 header, 13 float32 each, white tint); export_mesh(): a node-made mesh exported through a temporary copy; source_id()/set_id() derive ids from names
├── object_key.py                # compute(): an object's glb key — hash of the evaluated mesh (a skinned one in its rest shape), modifiers (geometry nodes by what they make: the evaluated mesh and its materials), materials + node trees + images, rig (bones and action, never the armature object's name or place), settings, EXPORT_VERSION — plus triangles / draw calls / surface area; geometry_info() for a node-made mesh; hash_tree() (also keys the HDRI)
├── export_cache.py              # this session's exports by object key (512 MB, least recently used out): a browser lacking a glb gets it again without a bake
├── mesh_memory.py               # float data of the modifier-evaluated meshes keyed this session: a mesh with the same topology + integer data and floats within 8 ULPs of a remembered one hashes those floats, so rounding (Bevel's UVs aren't bit-stable) keeps the key; copies share it, an undone edit finds its earlier one (256 MB, least recently used out)
├── web_settings.py              # Scene.skyray_web (Web Optimization): Max Texture, Bake Size / texel density, HDRI size, WebP/PNG, Meshopt/None, Skip Hidden; Snapshot (frozen per Send; signature() goes into object keys)
├── resource_pack.py             # GLTF_SEPARATE output → gzip glb whose images name their textures as skyray:<key> (data buffer moved to index 0 for meshopt), texture blobs keyed by content (content_key), image_size(), gpu_bytes()
│
│   # Export — one object → glb
├── gltf_exporter.py             # export_object() (Send path: capped textures, WebP/PNG, meshopt except animated, the object's own geometry only — no geometry-nodes or particle instances —, the clip named after the action, packed) and export_object_glb() (same pipeline as one lossless self-contained glb, for the fidelity suite); _prepared(): temp unparented/identity-transform duplicate in the scene collection, material preprocessing, cleanup
├── bake_device.py               # render_device(): Cycles on the GPU when Preferences has one enabled (else explicitly CPU); a failing GPU is given up for the session (is_device_error, give_up_gpu); gpu_hint() names an unused GPU
├── texture_cap.py               # cap_textures(): images above Max Texture swapped for scaled copies on per-slot material copies (node groups left alone)
├── material_flatten.py          # Surface that isn't one directly-wired Principled BSDF (e.g. Mix Shader) → one synthetic Principled
├── material_bake.py             # Cycles-bakes procedural Base Color/Roughness/Normal/Emission inputs to image textures (the exporter omits them otherwise; a Color Attribute × Image Texture base colour goes as COLOR_0); a bake that comes out flat ships as a factor; with the coat on (`_coat_bakes`) also Coat Weight/Roughness/Normal, the base bakes under shader_bake.coat_disabled()
├── material_coat.py             # coat post-pass on the exported glTF JSON (apply_coat_extras; inject_coat_extras on a GLB): extras.coat {ior?, tint?} and the clearcoatRoughnessFactor the exporter omits; owns inlined_principled() and has_coat(), which also gate material_bake's coat bakes
├── material_volume.py           # approximates Volume shaders (KHR_materials_volume nodes, or an alpha-blend fallback) — the exporter ignores the Volume socket
├── shader_bake.py               # shared bake plumbing: bake_size() (per-object resolution), new/tag/is_bake_image, flat_value() (a bake sampled where the faces land in UV space), find_principled_surface(), find_active_output(), emission-rewire socket bake, coat_disabled()
├── object_id.py                 # resolve_stable_ids(objects): batch-resolves `skyray_id` (custom property, survives renames) so a duplicate colliding with its original is decided deterministically (the holder this session knew under it, else by name); remembers each id by session_uid, so an undo that drops the property gets it back; get_existing_id(obj) is the side-effect-free lookup for the delete diff
├── sent_ids.py                  # ids included in the last successful object Send (Scene property skyray_sent_ids, also remembered for the session) — scene_graph.plan() diffs it to detect deletions
├── link_journal.py              # what the add-on wrote into the .blend since its last save (object ids, sent ids, the binding a Send used), mirrored to <user config>/skyray/links/<hash of the path>.json against that saved version (size + mtime): replayed by name when the same version is opened again, dropped on save or when the file changed on disk

│   # Channels — one *_operators.py (a SendChannelBase button) + *_sync.py (the payload) per concern

├── world_operators.py           # SKYRAY_OT_send_world — the Sky row
├── world_sync.py                # find_world_sky(): the Sky Texture the World really renders, walked from the active World Output's Surface as Cycles evaluates the tree (muted/invalid links dropped), plus its Background/Emission strength → sky payload (sunDisc only under Cycles)
├── world_hdri_operators.py      # SKYRAY_OT_send_world_hdri — the HDRI row
├── world_hdri_sync.py           # Material Preview's HDRI: the Environment Texture image re-encoded to Radiance HDR (at most the HDRI size, from a copy), or the Sky Texture baked to a 1K equirect; build_hdri_cached() skips an unchanged World; an image without pixels raises Unreadable ("Not found: <file>" / "Can't read: <file>"), hdri_problem() flags a missing file before a Send
├── light_operators.py           # SKYRAY_OT_send_lighting — the Lights row
├── light_sync.py                # Light objects → world-space position + unit direction (computed in Python), type/color/energyWatts/normalize/castShadow/shadowSoftSize/shadowFilterRadius/spot/area shape+size fields (color and power fold EEVEE's exposure and temperature tint; normalize is sent, not folded in); same stable id as scene_graph.py
├── render_settings_operators.py # SKYRAY_OT_send_render_settings — the Render row
├── render_settings_sync.py      # scene color management as the viewport display shader applies it (display device/emulation, view transform, look, exposure, gamma, white balance, curves, dither) + resolutionX/Y and pixelAspectX/Y (resolution and pixel aspect only give the synced camera's frame aspect)
├── curve_tables.py              # view_settings.curve_mapping → the per-channel tables Blender's GPU display shader reads (Combined curve premultiplied into R/G/B); render_settings_sync's `curves`
├── camera_operators.py          # SKYRAY_OT_send_camera — the Camera row
├── camera_sync.py               # Camera objects → optics only (lens, sensor size + fit, shift, clip, ortho scale, viewport display size); transform stays scene_graph.py's job
└── icons/                       # logo.png, dot_{green,amber,red,blue,grey}.png (icons.py)
