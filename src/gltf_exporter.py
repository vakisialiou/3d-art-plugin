"""Exports a single Blender object via Blender's own glTF exporter —
geometry + materials only; the Send builds the transform from scene_graph.py.

export_yup=False breaks the glTF spec on purpose: only our own GLTFLoader reads
this file, and 3d-art-web's scene is Z-up like Blender (THREE.Object3D.DEFAULT_UP
in render.worker.ts), so there is no axis conversion anywhere in the pipeline.

export_object() is the Send's path: textures at most the scene's Max Texture,
WebP or PNG, meshopt-compressed geometry, packed by resource_pack.py into a
glb that names its textures by key. export_object_glb() is the same pipeline
as one self-contained, lossless glb, for tools (the material fidelity suite
judges the bakes, not the transport).

An object's glb holds its own geometry only: geometry-nodes and particle
instances travel as instance sets (instance_sets.py), each exporting its
source on its own.
