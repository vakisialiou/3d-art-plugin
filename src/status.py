"""The connection status the panel, the status bar and every Send button's
poll() read. evaluate() turns the worker's snapshot plus the active scene's
binding into one state — the first failing check wins:

NOT_CONNECTED (WAITING_APPROVAL while pairing) → ONLINE_ACCESS_OFF →
CONNECTING / OFFLINE → OUTDATED → NO_PROJECT → NO_BROWSER → READY.

Only runtime.py's main-thread timer sets the current status; no bpy here.
