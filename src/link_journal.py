"""Link data the add-on writes into the open .blend — object ids, the last
Send's ids, the project a Send went to — kept in a journal outside the file
as well, until the file is saved. Blender has no persistent object id of its
own (an ID's session_uid lives one session), so these exist only as data in
the file: closed without saving, or after a crash, they would be gone and
the next Send would make every object new in the browser.

A journal belongs to one saved version of one file: <config>/skyray/links/
<hash of the path>.json, holding the size and mtime that version has on
disk. It records each object and scene under its name in that version — a
rename never saved reverts with the file, and whatever was created after the
last save is gone with it. Saving the file deletes the journal (the file now
holds it all); opening the same version again replays it into the file's
data; a file changed on disk in between (saved from elsewhere, replaced)
drops it instead.
